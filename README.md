# Malarial Cell Classifier 

## Summary
In this project, I utilized image data provided by Kaggle during their 2018 Data Science Challenge and, I implemented a 
convolutional neural network using tensorflow based Keras. This convolutional neural network attained a maximum of 99.02%
accuracy with 25 epochs. Additional information can be derived from the performace graph in the repository.
